  * Jonathan’s Metrics on Predicted amount of data needed
* Cronbach Sampling Technique (in order t predicted necessary number of samples)
    * Almost like a p value chart
* Domain level confusion matrix
    * reduce level of noise
* 500,000 vs 1,000,000 —> 50 to 300 (see Cronbach recommendations)
    * Formula Visualizations
* Attention Mechanism
* Previous Annotation Techniques no longer used - highlight text and classify (binary decisions)
* Self supervised/unsupervised system
* Hyper-parameter finetuning stages
* Conversational Discourse Architecture
    * Network of Networks
    * Attention Mechanisms
    * Cluster Analyses
* Regular Expressions
    * Failure Rate
    * Embed backinto system
    * Right Training
    * Directionally useful intent accuracy
    * 80 classes vs 140 classes 
* Payment related FAQs domain - focus on all high volume faqs with high semantic overlap
* Discovery Mode
* 750K conversations 
* 777,000 relatively small sample
* distribution across target classes
* Jonthan’s questions- understanding dashboard.
* COVA conversational. topic distribution by domain
    * Existing + Existing + ML Labels
    * Code to GitHub ask developer
    * go find guy’s —> code snippet
* Live chats
    * 100 K
    * 650 K
